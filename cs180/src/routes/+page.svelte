        <p class="font-mono text-lg py-2 px-4 text-justify">This website will showcase the group Theodore's output for the CS180 project where the task was to make two versionf of machine learning models to predict the diseases of a potato plant based on an input image.</p>
        <p class="font-mono text-lg py-2 px-4 text-justify">There have been two models developed as different solutions or approaches to the problem called Model A and Model B:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-left font-mono text-lg pl-8 py-2 pr-4">
            <li>Model A: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model using Resnet framework that uses a traditional approach to image classification.</li>
            <li>Model B: A Vision Transformer (ViT) based model that employs a transformer architecture for image classification.</li>
